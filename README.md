# AI-Art-Assistant

## Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for empowering artists in navigating the dynamic landscape of contemporary art creation. In response to the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving digital age, our aim is to provide artists with a platform that facilitates artistic exploration and innovation. 

By harnessing the capabilities of AI, we intend to enable creators to generate new and original masterpieces that not only reflect their distinct individual styles but also seamlessly blend the timeless artistic legacies of the past with the vibrancy of present-day creativity. Through this initiative, we aspire to inspire and captivate both artists and art enthusiasts, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression in the digital era and fostering a harmonious synergy between tradition and innovation.

## Overview
- Art_mood:
    - Objective: An attempt to utilise Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN), art_mood explores mood transfer in images. The project endeavors to transform images based on textual mood input, employing innovative AI techniques to blend colors and evoke distinct emotional atmospheres.
      
- Diffusion_model:
    - Objective: The diffusion_model project focuses on art and style transfer, leveraging advanced techniques to seamlessly integrate artistic styles into images. By exploring diffusion models, the project aims to elevate the process of transferring artistic content, contributing to the realm of creative expression in digital art.
 
- CLIP_Score:
    - Objective: Used in Evaluation part of our project, where we compared the generative ability of text-to-image models for VQGAN+CLIP and diffusion model. It calculates how similar an image output is to it's text input.

- Evaluation Metrics:
    - Objective: Used to evaluate the performance of the models.
