# Evaluation Metrics Folder Overview

This repository includes three evaluation metrics designed for text-to-image models. The following provides a brief overview of these metrics:

1. **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
2. **Style Transfer**
3. **CLIP Score**

## Instructions on How to Run the Evaluation Metrics

### PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

To utilize the PSNR metric, follow the steps below:

1. Update line 37 with the path to the style image.
2. Update line 40 with the path to the model-generated image.
3. Run the following Python script:
   ```python
   python psnr.py
    ```

### Style Loss

For the Style Transfer metric, adhere to the following instructions:

1. Update line 10 with the path to the style image.
2. Update line 11 with the path to the model-generated image.
3. Run the following Python script:
    ```python
    python style_loss.py
    ```

### CLIP Score

For the CLIP Score metric, adhere to the following instructions:


1. Install PyTorch:
  ```
  pip install torch 
  ```
2. Install CLIP:
  ```
  pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
  ```
3. Install clip-score from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/clip-score/):
  ```
  pip install clip-score
  ```
4. "image" folder links with "text" folder, which is an image generated by VQGAN+CLIP with the text prompt
5. "image-2" folder links with "text-2" folder, which is an image generated by the diffusion model with the same text prompt as VQGAN+CLIP
6. Run the following command to get the CLIP Score for VQGAN+CLIP:
```
python -m clip_score image text
```
7. Run the following command to get the CLIP Score for diffusion model:
```
python -m clip_score image-2 text-2
```
